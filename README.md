# PauseVaultTimerOnEntry
THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED INTO VH3.11.3 (vh mod jar: the_vault-1.18.2-3.11.0.2611.jar), therefore I am archiving it and removing it from curseforge

This server-side mod pauses timer when you enter vault and resumes it after you move certain distance.<br>
Default distance is 18, which is enough to allow free movement in the first room. (this is 2D distance, so you can be at any height)<br>
This allows you to let the chunks load when you are in the first room without losing vault time.
