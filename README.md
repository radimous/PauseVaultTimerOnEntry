# PauseVaultTimerOnEntry
This server-side mod pauses timer when you enter vault and resumes it after you move certain distance.<br>
Default distance is 20, which is enough to allow free movement in the first room. (this is 2D distance, so you can be at any height)<br>
This allows you to let the chunks load when you are in the first room without losing vault time.
